# Python-Tower-of-Hanoi-Stack-Game U of T
### This was a solo project done in PYTHON where I created a simulation of the "Tower of Hanoi" puzzle game. I used PYTHON's tkinter for the graphics. In this project, I used object oriented programming to create and manipulate objects to create a solid code infrustructure. I also learned about STACKS and QUEUES and how to implement them as objects. ###
